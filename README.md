# Senior-Project

Facial Emotion Recognition project by CMPE 195 B/F Group 27: Sanyami Bhavsar, Sadhana Indukuri, and Ajinkya Mate. This project uses machine learning to get input from a webcam stream to recognize facial expressions to detect possible test anxiety in students while taking an online test, and provides calming exercises in case of suspected test anxiety. 

To build and run this project, make sure you have all the necessary libraries like streamlit, Keras, NumPy, TensorFlow, Pillow, and OpenCV. Also, make sure you have at least Python 3.6 installed. Then, navigate to the directory with the file 'entry.py' and then in the terminal/Windows Powershell, run the command: streamlit run entry.py

The Web application will then open in your web browser.
