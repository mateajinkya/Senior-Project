# Senior-Project

This only has the project code, it does not have the test and train datasets as those are way to big. I will add those at a later date, but if your did the coursera course you should have the dataset. Just put the test and train folders into the same folder as the rest of this project code. 

to run navigate to the folder with entry.py and run the following in terminal:
streamlit run entry.py

Also, ensure you have the correct libraries
